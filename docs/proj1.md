# Project 1


Goal: 
- start something that another groups will say
"yes, for Project2, we want to finish that".

Something to think about: 
- In proj2 you can win bonus points it can show that yu ahve done something to proj1 code such that proj2 cde now scales
to problems 100 to 1000 times bigger than proj1 (where "bigger" is measured in some problem specific way like user/data set size/repsonse speed).

You must deliever:
- something that executes **some** of your goals, 
- a [roadmap](https://github.com/se20z09/units_converter_extension/projects/1) telling others
  **where to go from here**
- all the "bling" (described below) needed to convince another group that they should use your system.

## Start by Picking  a Project

(Hint: do it now!)

Pick something. Code it in any language using any tools you like. But

- everyone on the team has to use the same tools
- all the work has to be shared via Github (public repos, 
  general GH-- not NCSU):

Pick something that  was  popular in
    [2020](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnNlF0Gx6E5oppd7LpeYy_mNuUkhgh30PiC2Z3RrGXI/edit#gid=0)
or  [2021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/164qCnYK2K_1X9EBd72wGfD1FsGpwAqrAhC5s2X5uy8A/edit#gid=0)
(look for the things that got most votes).

- Heck, even get a kick start by starting  with a project from last year.

What to do? Well pick something:

- Cool: 
  - Cause you have to impress;
- Not ambitious:
  - So you can make significant progress in 4 weeks;
- Not too small: 
  - So you can  impress people with the work;
- Small enough:
  - So you can finish;
- Where there is something already running:
  - So you get going fast;
- Something the whole team can contribute to
  - Work in  a language that everyone in the team can handle:
  - Work on a problem everyone can understand

If you want to be in the running for "projects
that survivie into the next round"
your system has to do something better then something else.

- Which means your code has to address some problem in some current system
- And do so in a manner that is quantifiable.

**IMPORTANT**: if you start your work using older projects from
    [2020](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnNlF0Gx6E5oppd7LpeYy_mNuUkhgh30PiC2Z3RrGXI/edit#gid=0)
or  [2021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/164qCnYK2K_1X9EBd72wGfD1FsGpwAqrAhC5s2X5uy8A/edit#gid=0),
then 
you must show your tutor:
-  in week3 a **two minute video** showing the old functionality;
-  when project1 is dues, a **two minute video** showing the new functionality.

What are the features of  the  following repos that make them "good"?

- http://docopt.org
- https://github.com/harshitpatel96/GITS
- https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageInTerminal.jl
- https://github.com/daniruiz/dotfiles
- https://github.com/chalk/chalk
- https://github.com/marcotcr/lime

## On the merits of a "boast video"

Yes, when "selling" your project it is tempting to prepare a short glossy video. 
- But consider, many of the above GH repos have no videom but very informative text/graphics
- So reflect on the value of "fluffy video" that might bother someone,
  - Versus actual succinct semantic comments.

## Good practices for Effecive Teaming



|What | Notes|
|-----|------|
|Location| Meet however it makes teams most comfortable (in-person, on-line, whatever the team agrees on).|
|Duration| Usually, keep meetings short (exception: long range direction meetings) |
|End of meeting | Always agree on next meeting time before this meeting ends.|
|| Review everyone's to do list|
|Start of meeting | review everyone's to do lists from last meeting|
|Misc | Group members attended group sessions|
|Distrbuted dev model: | decisions made by unanmyous vote|
|| group meetings had a round robin speaking order|
|| group meetings had a moderator that managed the round robin| 
|| group meeting moderator rotated among  the group|

## Grading

Your work will be assessed via how many of the 
<a href="https://go.pardot.com/l/6342/2017-10-24/3xr3f2/6342/188781/Publication_LinuxKernelReport_2017.pdf">Linux Kernel Best Practices</a>
 (see pages 25,26)
you can emulate.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29195/129657782-3b32c13e-6283-4812-9d49-3cf1c062820d.png)

- Reflect on our the rubric, shown below.
- Write a 2 page pdf on the commnection between the items in that rubric and the Linux Kernel best practices.
  And that document to your repo as docs/proj1rubricComments.pdf. Write the that pdf using
  [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty)
  - Not "nearly" this template. This tempalte. Learn Latex. Hit: use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
- Copy the rubric to a markdown file. Fill it in. Where needed, add links into your repo to justify your answers.
  And that document to your repo as docs/proj1rubric.md.



# Rubric

Prepare a  markdown  with **three** columns:

- Column1 has all the following points PLUS all the  points from the
  [Software Sustainability Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform).
- Column2  is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one  (a litte),  two (somewhat), three (a lot).
- Column3 is for any links you  are adding to support your claim in column two.
- At the top,  show the sum of column2,

|-----|---------|
|video1 | For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of old functionality| 
|video2 | For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old| 
|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|in GH|
| Number of commits: by different people|in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**|
|  issues are being  closed|evidence in GH|
| DOI badge: exists |in GH|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
| Use of version control tools|
|Use of  style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|
| Use of code  formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
| Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
| Use of code coverage |config files in GH|
| other automated analysis tools|config files in GH|
| test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
| test cases are routinely executed|e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
| issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
| Chat channel: exists|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
