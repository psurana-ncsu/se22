Work solo. **IMPORTANT**: read [the lecture on ethics](/docs/ethics.md) before you start.


## Word limit
- No less that three pages (in the format shown below, excluding references);
  - no more than four
- HARD LIMITS: 
  - we will not grade after four pages.
  - we will not read if less than three.


## What to write
- Using these <a href="/etc/img/12steps.png">7 steps</a> as an outline
- Address one of the [case studies](https://onlineethics.org/resources?combine=software&field_keywords_target_id=&field_resource_type_target_id=13236)


YOur answer must cover, at the very least:
- who is _hurt_ by the current design;
- how we might _fix_ that?
  - Important: ensure that your  text justifies why  the new design addresses the  problems you document.
- and how will your fix _empower traditionally disempowered social groups_?
  - ie. don't just fix this particular problem; rather, address   deeper issues that might cause problems in the future).
