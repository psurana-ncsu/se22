01103 James B Hunt Jr Centenniel   

## Overview

### Topics

This is an _advanced graduate_ class. 
In this subject, students will be taught about etical SE the start of the art in how to:

- Write "good" software;
  - Working in teams, deliver a systems of acceptable quality within eh available resources;  
  - That  someone else would want to use;
  - That is demonstrable _good_ (compared to something else).
- Learn the  state of the art in SE

### Prerequisites

+ CSC 316 and CSC 226 (or equivalent)

### Textbook

+ Optional, purchase not necessary
  -  [Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, 8th International edition](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Practitioners-Roger-Pressman/dp/0078022126/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Software+Engineering%3A+A+Practitioner%27s+Approach&qid=1596502362&sr=8-1)
by Roger Pressman 

### Class Discord Group

It is each student's responsibility to join the class Discord  group "cs510, fall 2022". Till Friday week1, the link to join there is [here](https://discord.gg/SpsaeeUw).

All class communication from staff to students will be via this Discord group.

+ Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their 
  questions and answers to that shared resource.
+ Note that, for communication of a more private nature, 
  contact the lecturer on the email shown below.


## Assessment

Grades come from 
- 5 homeworks
- 2 projects 
- 1 pitch session (where you try to "sell" your project1 to other groups)
- 1 mid-session exam 
- 1 final exam
- 1 essay (due Dec4, but details already posted).  Feel free to submit early.
- Participating in trials of other people's software.
- Bonus marks (maybe +1 from essay; maybe +4 from project1; maybe +4 from project2).

Exams and essays are done individually. Everything else is done in  
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KKskduN7m1R3WYhQTLyWJgxkAvrp2UV-LEu5JWN26xo/edit#gid=0">groups of 5</a>.

- Homeworks are small tasks 
  - graded 0 (for no submission), 1 (for "please try again") and 2 for "good".
  - may be submitted multiple times
- Projects comprise two  large tasks  (groups of 5 people, working in public Github repos-- not NCSU GH):
  - Starting with 50 tasks in project1, we'll focus in on the best half, for
    project2 
    - **Four bonus marks** if other people jump to your task.i for their task.i+1 work
  - Project1: you'll start some task
  - Project2: you'll significantly extend someone else's task (thereby learning the important of documentation, 
    design purity, regression tests, etc).
- To support the lab work
  - Students get 10 marks for participating (\*) in other project's labs

(\*) And by "participate" we mean that students need to attend  lab sessions organized by other groups.
This means you will be collecting lab data from your peers. This also means you are now the guardians of that private data. 
You will lose marks if that data collection violates the following three rights:

|Right| Notes|
|-----|------|
|The **right to  privacy**|No one should be able to identify individuals in your data. Don't store free text names in Github!|
| The **right to refuse**| Any member of this class, when called to an lab session, has the right to decline to participate without having to explain why (in which case, they still get their chit).|
| The **right to be forgotten**| Any one you collect data from has the right to require their data deleted from your study. So keep anonymous ids for everyone, keep a mapping table real name to anonymous (outside of Github).|

### Grades

|group |mark   | notes                                   |

sesssion. If there are no bookings, consultation time will be cancelled.

Consultation times are Mon,Tue,Wed,Thurs,Frid at 2pm to 4pm. 


Consultations will be conducted via ZOOMs (why? cause we polled students prior to class starting and that was the majority

## Other Information

### Attendance

- Lectures are twice a week.
- Tutorial sessions are optional, but please use our tutorial resources
  to help you along.
- Please make sure you experience the lectures (either live or watching
  the recoding).
- Aside from that, you have  to service all your homework, and prokect
  commitments. It is very bad to be absent from your project except
  for anticipated abseonces condonned by the univerisity:
     - Representing an official university function (e.g. athletics)
     - Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.
     - Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances 
     - Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated absences. Examples include:
     - Short-term illness or injury
     - Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately. 

On top of that, Covid-related issues will, of course, also be excused.

(And no where on that list is "I have to go to a wedding in India".)

### Expected Workload

 Students must be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
lecture meeting). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject.

Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to
attend a review session, during their consultation
time. There, students may be asked to review code,
concepts, or comment on the structure of the
course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to
attend will result in marks being deducted.

### Academic Integrity

Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagerism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:

+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.

Students are encouraged to read each others code and report **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:

+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.

All students are expected to maintain traditional
standards of academic integrity by giving proper
credit for all work.  All suspected cases of
academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued.
You should be aware of the University policy on
academic integrity found in the Code of Student
Conduct.
 
The  exams will be done individually.  Academic integrity is important.  Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Resource Office at Holmes Hall, Suite 304, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653. For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation (REG02.20.01) (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-01/).

Students are responsible for reviewing the PRRs
which pertain to their course rights and
responsibilities. These include:
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05)
(Equal
Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Policy
Statement),
[https://oied.ncsu.edu/home/](https://oied.ncsu.edu/home/)
(Office for Institutional Equity and
Diversity),
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01)
(Code of Student Conduct), and
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03](http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03)
(Grades and Grade Point Average).

### Policy on Incomplete Grades

If an extended deadline is not authorized by the Graduate School,
an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F
after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the
student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) by the
end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is
shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted
course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade
is the responsibility of the student. The university policy on
incomplete grades is located at
http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03. Additional
information relative to incomplete grades for graduate students can
be found in the Graduate Administrative Handbook in Section 3.18.F
at http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/handbook/index.php

### Late Assignments Policy

Homeworks become late 2 weeks after after the dates listed above.  Late homeworks earn zero marks.

For project deliverables, students will lose 1 mark per day for late submissions (weekend = 1 day).

### Digital Course Components

Instructors are not responsible for ensuring privacy
or accessibility of electronic materials that are not required
components of the course (e.g., links to supplemental information
that is not part of the required reading list). However, instructors
should judiciously consider the privacy, copyright, and accessibility
of supplemental links provided to students and warn them of any
known issues or concerns in this regard. See Online Course Material
Host Requirements (NCSU REG 08.00.11).

### Non-Discrimination Policy
 <img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4276/34435689480_2e6f358510_k_d.jpg" align=right width=500>

NC State provides equal opportunity and affirmative action efforts,
and prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation ("Prohibited Conduct") that are based upon a person's
race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin,
age (40 or older), disability, gender identity, genetic information,
sexual orientation, or veteran status (individually and collectively,
"Protected Status"). Additional information as to each Protected
Status is included in NCSU REG 04.25.02 (Discrimination, Harassment
and Retaliation Complaint Procedure). NC State's policies and
regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation
may be accessed at http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05 or
https://oied.ncsu.edu/divweb/. Any person who feels that he or she
has been the subject of prohibited discrimination, harassment, or
retaliation should contact the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO)
at 919-515-3148.

+ Note that, as a lecturer, I am legally required to
**report** all such acts to the campus policy<sup>1</sup>.

<sup>1</sup>Note that any remark you make
in some on-line comment tracking system like Github
is a public document.
So take heed of the following cautionary tale.
One year, a student was joking around with
his buddy in a Github issue report. Then he was
rude enough and stupid enough to 
add a remark about how the rest of the
team was just so
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;.
Needless to say,
the rest of the team took great
offense at this remark and invoked the University's
non-discrimination policies. As a result, everyone
lost much time that semester, as well as grades. 

Retaliation
against any person who complains about
discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's
policies and regulations covering discrimination,
harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05) or
[http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/](http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/).
Any person who feels
that he or she has been the subject of prohibited
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should
contact the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) at
919-515-3148.

### Liability Insurance.

(Included for completeness... but this is not text that is really relevant to this semester.)

Non-scheduled class time for field trips or
out-of-class activities are NOT required for this
class. No such trips are currently planned.

However,
if they do happen then students are required to
purchase liability insurance. For more information,
see [http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/insurance/](http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/insurance/).

## COVID-Related Issues

<img align=right width=500 src="https://i1.wp.com/scng-dash.digitalfirstmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-model.jpg">
Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, public health measures have been implemented across
campus. Students should stay current with these practices and expectations through the 
Protect the Pack
website (https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/). The sections below provide expectations and conduct
related to COVID-19 issues.


### Health and Participation in Class

We are most concerned about your health and the health of your classmates and instructors/TAs.

- If you test positive for COVID-19, or are told by a healthcare provider that you are presumed
positive for the virus, please work with your instructor on health accommodations and follow
other university guidelines, including [self-reporting](https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/). Self-reporting is not only to help
provide support to you, but also to assist in contact tracing for containing the spread of the virus.
-  If you feel unwell, even if you have not been knowingly exposed to COVID-19, please do not
come to class.
- If you are in quarantine, have been notified that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, or
have a personal or family situation related to COVID-19 that prevents you from attending this
course in person (or synchronously), please connect with your instructor to discuss the situation
and make alternative plans, as necessary.
- If you need to make a request for an academic consideration related to COVID-19, such as a
discussion about possible options for remote learning, please talk with your instructor for the
appropriate process to make a COVID-19 request.

### Health and Well-Being Resources

These are difficult times, and academic and personal stress is a natural result. Everyone is encouraged to
take care of themselves and their peers. If you need additional support, there are many resources on
campus to help you:

- Counseling Center (https://counseling.dasa.ncsu.edu/)
-  Health Center (https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/)
- If the personal behavior of a classmate concerns or worries you, either for the classmate’s well-
being or yours, we encourage you to report this behavior to the NC State CARES team:
(https://advising.dasa.ncsu.edu/resources-for-advisors/advisors-toolkit/cares/)
- If you or someone you know are experiencing food, housing or financial insecurity, please see
the Pack Essentials Program (https://dasa.ncsu.edu/pack-essentials/).

### Community Standards related to COVID-19

We are all responsible for protecting ourselves and our community. Please see the community
expectations and Rule 04.21.01 regarding Personal Safety Requirements Related to COVID-19 https://policies.ncsu.edu/rule/rul-04-21-01/

### Course Expectations Related to COVID-19:

- Personal Protective Equipment: As a member of the NC State academic community you are
required to follow all university guidelines for personal safety with face coverings, physical
distancing, and sanitation. Face coverings are required in this class and in all NC State
buildings. Face coverings should be worn to cover the nose and mouth and be close fitting to the
face with minimal gaps on the sides. In addition, students are responsible for keeping their
course/work area clean.
  - You are  expected to wear masks in  lectures.
  - It is your choice  to decide if you  don't want to do that.
  - If you do that, then my  choice will be to
    - Stop the lecture and wait till you out  a mask on.
    - Report you at the 
      [COVID-19 Community Standards Reporting Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?NCStateUniv&layout_id=31)
      "behavior they believe the University should take formal disciplinary action":
